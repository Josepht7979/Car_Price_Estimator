# Car Price Estimator

Car Price Estimation using Machine Learning Algorithm

In this project, I created a ML model to predict the a car price based on various factors. 
The Dataset is obtained from KAGGLE ,And i cleaned up values with no Showroom Price.

Used Car prices are influmced by a variety of factors.
I picked up the top features that effect car price the most andthen created fields for users to feed in and get a closest price of their car based on machine learning model.

Created an APP as well for ease of use.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
Python / Pandas/ Matplotlib
HTML/CSS
Python/Flask
SkLearn
Heroku App

Used a Random Forest Regression Model 
and SKLEARN - Simple and efficient tool for predictive data analysisÂ· Built on NumPy, Matplotlib ,JSON etc
And eventually deployed it onto Heroku

Machine learning Algorithm used is 
a RANDOM FOREST REGRESSION MODEL
Random Forest Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that uses ensemble learning method for regression. Ensemble learning method is a technique that combines predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms to make a more accurate prediction than a single model
