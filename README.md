# Car Price Estimator

Created an APP to Estimate the Price of your car through machine learning model

TECHNOLOGIES USED
Python / Pandas/ Matplotlib
HTML/CSS
Python/Flask
SkLearn
Heroku App

The Dataset is obtained from KAGGLE ,Cleaned up values with no Showroom Price.

Used a Random Forest Regression Model 
and SKLEARN - Simple and efficient tool for predictive data analysisÂ· Built on NumPy, Matplotlib ,JSON etc
And eventually deployed it onto Heroku

Machine learning Algorithm used is 
a RANDOM FOREST REGRESSION MODEL
Random Forest Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that uses ensemble learning method for regression. Ensemble learning method is a technique that combines predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms to make a more accurate prediction than a single model
